# Project Progress

## Completed Tasks ✅

### Phase 1 – Infrastructure & Standards
- ✅ **Repo Scaffold & CI** (Plan 1) – Monorepo with pnpm workspaces, GitHub Actions CI workflow
- ✅ **Lint / Format Baseline** (Plan 2) – ESLint + Prettier + Husky pre-commit hooks configured

### Documentation & Planning
- ✅ **Complete Specification** – Detailed spec.md with all functional requirements (SPR-FR-1 through SPR-FR-11)
- ✅ **Comprehensive Todo List** – 36 organized tasks across 9 phases
- ✅ **Detailed Execution Plan** – TDD-driven prompt_plan.md with step-by-step implementation
- ✅ **Random Sprite Generator** – Added feature specification with component templates for procedural sprite generation

## Current Status 📍

**Infrastructure**: ✅ Complete
- Monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Linting and formatting standards established
- Git hooks for code quality enforcement

**Planning**: ✅ Complete
- All 11 functional requirements defined
- Detailed UI/UX layout specified
- Data models and export formats documented
- Component architecture for random sprite generation

### Phase 2 – Core Data Models

- ✅ **Define Sprite JSON Schema** (Plan 3) – `schemas/sprite.schema.json` + failing validation test passed

## Next Steps 🎯

Ready to begin **Plan 4: Core Data Model Implementation (covers Plan 3 tests)**

```prompt
Implement `src/model/Sprite.ts` with TypeBox + ajv validation.  
Make the schema test from Plan 3 pass.  
Commit: "feat(model): Sprite data model".
```

This will establish the foundation for our sprite data model, including support for:

- Multi-layer sprite structure
- Animation timelines with frame durations
- 256-color palette management
- Palette-swap variants
- Random sprite generator component templates

The TDD approach ensures we build robust, tested functionality from the ground up before moving to UI implementation in Phase 3.
