# Project Progress

## Completed Tasks ✅

### Phase 1 – Infrastructure & Standards
- ✅ **Repo Scaffold & CI** (Plan 1) – Monorepo with pnpm workspaces, GitHub Actions CI workflow
- ✅ **Lint / Format Baseline** (Plan 2) – ESLint + Prettier + Husky pre-commit hooks configured

### Documentation & Planning
- ✅ **Complete Specification** – Detailed spec.md with all functional requirements (SPR-FR-1 through SPR-FR-11)
- ✅ **Comprehensive Todo List** – 36 organized tasks across 9 phases
- ✅ **Detailed Execution Plan** – TDD-driven prompt_plan.md with step-by-step implementation
- ✅ **Random Sprite Generator** – Added feature specification with component templates for procedural sprite generation

### Phase 2 – Core Data Models
- ✅ **Define Sprite JSON Schema** (Plan 3) – `schemas/sprite.schema.json` + failing validation test passed
- ✅ **Core Data Model Implementation** (Plan 4) – Implemented `src/model/Sprite.ts` with TypeBox + AJV validation; schema tests passing
- ✅ **Palette Model & Utilities** (Plan 5) – ✅ COMPLETED: Implemented `src/model/Palette.ts` with 256-color limit, ASE import, palette swapping; 15 comprehensive tests passing

## Current Status 📍

**Infrastructure**: ✅ Complete
- Monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Linting and formatting standards established
- Git hooks for code quality enforcement

**Planning**: ✅ Complete

- All 11 functional requirements defined
- Detailed UI/UX layout specified
- Data models and export formats documented
- Component architecture for random sprite generation

## Next Steps 🎯

Ready to begin **Phase 3: UI Implementation**

This phase will focus on building out the user interface components and integrating them with the core data models and utilities established in Phase 2. Key tasks include:

- Developing the sprite editor UI
- Implementing the random sprite generator component
- Integrating palette management features
- Building out the animation timeline editor

The foundation is set for a robust and flexible sprite creation and editing tool, leveraging the power of procedural generation and comprehensive data modeling.
